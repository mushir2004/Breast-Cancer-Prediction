## About The Project

A breast cancer prediction model utilizing machine learning techniques is a sophisticated algorithmic system designed to analyze various factors and patterns associated with breast cancer. It typically integrates vast datasets. Through iterative training and validation processes using labeled data, the model becomes increasingly accurate in its predictions, enabling healthcare professionals to intervene early and provide personalized care to patients at higher risk of breast cancer.








## Built With

In this project, I used Google Colab for coding and some open-source Python library like numpy and pandas, etc

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
1. Go to code section.
2. Copy the link.
3. OR Download the the complete file.

### Prerequisites

Go to Google Colab, then you can straight start coding.

### Installation

1. import numpy as np
2. import pandas as pd
3. import sklearn.datasets


## Usage

This model prediction the type of tumor found in breast cancer.
It show [0] Malignant and [1] for benign.


## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/mushir2004/ReadME.md/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
